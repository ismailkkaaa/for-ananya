                    Heyy ananya long time no seee I just wanted to say that this day Feb 16 we talked about our love to each other and it's been a year but only 6 months we got together but that 6 months time we no I sure hope I enjoyed our relationship even the times you went abroad and went silent for a Month but I was happy to see you and the small meet ups we had i totally loved you that's why I kinda overthink all the time and there was the time I made you sad I regret it till now but that's why I was always being bad also I was kinda pushing too and when I see you my heart races I don't what to say to you but I always wanted to talk to too for hours and see you all the time I almost shared my side of character to you. You never told me anything soo I thought to give you some time and space but we grew distant and kinda like strangers that's why I often try to call you even if it involves risk I tried my best to enjoy our relationship but you always was scared of getting caught by your parents I loved you that's why I pushed you away from mee don't hate me okk Yours anandhuuu(⁠・⁠o⁠・⁠))

                    Heyy penne 😂 it was nice to call you seeing you annoyed The real reason I broke up with you is it's because I was in real pressure it was my first serious and first actual relationship because u actually cared for me and I don't know how to cheer you up because all the time I see you when we meet you were always looking sad or worried and thinking of something else that's what I thought and I was scared point it out because I thought it would hurt you I always think u are just a kid maybe you don't know how to love I didn't know either all I had is trauma and rejection I don't know how to love so I tried my best to give you everything even when I was tired or sick just for you but as usual you cared it like nothing My efforts got wasted trying to make you happy in the end I got hurt and and I thought maybe you aren't the one for me or you just needed time My friends told me that from the beginning that we are totally the opposite and this relationship won't last longer so I tried to make it last longer because my ego and my love for you destroyed my ego and turned me into a soft guy and i was blind to love you unconditionally and put you before mee and seeing you treating me like a stranger I lose my everything and i thought maybe ending this relationship is better than getting hurt that's why i broke up with you it's hurting to see you smile because i used to enjoy that but now i can only look from far away and think as it like a life lesson i am letting you goo i won't back to disturb you peace out yours coolest ex : anandhu 😌
